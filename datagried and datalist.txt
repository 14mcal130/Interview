1. Datagrid has paging while Datalist doesnt.

2. Datalist has a property called repeat.
Direction=vertical/horizontal.(This is of great help in
designing layouts). This is not there in Datagrid.

3. A repeater is used when more intimate control over html
generation is required.

4. When only checkboxes/radiobuttons are repeatedly served
then a checkboxlist or radiobuttonlist are used as they
involve fewer overheads than a Datagrid.
